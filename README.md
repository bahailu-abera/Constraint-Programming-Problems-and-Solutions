# Constraint Programming Problems and Solutions

Welcome to the **Constraint Programming Problems and Solutions** repository! This is a collection of constraint programming problems, their solutions, and resources to help you learn and practice constraint programming.

## üöÄ **About This Repository**

Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial problems. However, finding well-structured problems and solutions can be challenging, especially for beginners. This repository aims to:
- Provide a curated collection of constraint programming problems.
- Offer clear and well-documented solutions using tools like MiniZinc.
- Serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in CP.
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from the community.

## üìÇ **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:
- **`problems/`**: Contains individual problem folders. Each folder includes:
  - `description.md`: A detailed description of the problem.
  - `model.mzn`: The MiniZinc model for the problem.
  - `data.dzn`: Data files (if applicable).
  - `solution.md`: An explanation of the solution and approach.
- **`resources/`**: Contains learning resources, including books, tutorials, and tools.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guidelines for contributing to this repository.
- **`LICENSE`**: The license under which this repository is shared.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use This Repository**

1. **Browse Problems**: Navigate to the `problems/` folder and explore the problems.
2. **Run Models**: Use a MiniZinc IDE or solver to run the models and experiment with the solutions.
3. **Learn**: Check out the `resources/` folder for books, tutorials, and tools to deepen your understanding of constraint programming.
4. **Contribute**: If you‚Äôd like to add a problem, improve a solution, or suggest a resource, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## üåü **How It Started**

I started this repository as a personal project to document my journey in learning constraint programming. As I solved problems from various sources, I realized that having a centralized collection of problems and solutions would be incredibly helpful for others. My goal is to create a collaborative space where learners and practitioners can share their knowledge and grow together.
